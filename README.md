## Overview

HyperChanger is an LSPosed module for selected Xiaomi HyperOS 4 Beta builds. It exposes System UI, notification shade, lock-screen, and camera-related customization in one companion app. The module is intended for rooted devices and does not replace System UI or Xiaomi Camera applications.

The project is in beta. HyperOS framework classes and resources can differ by device, region, and system build. A setting that works on one build may be unavailable or behave differently on another.

## Features

### Notification shade and Control Center

- Adjust visual materials for notification and Control Center elements.
- Configure notification and Control Center backgrounds independently.
- Tune Control Center corner and presentation options.
- Save user presets, apply built-in presets, and exchange presets as JSON or QR codes.

### System UI and Lock Screen

- Customize compatible Dynamic Island and focus-notification behavior.
- Adjust status-bar presentation where supported by the target build.
- Control selected lock-screen effects, including charging text and shortcut appearance.
- Restart individual scoped processes from the app after changing settings.

### Camera and Gallery

- Configure compatible Xiaomi Camera behavior.
- Enable selected Gallery and media-editor integrations when their packages are present.
- Keep unsupported packages inactive instead of applying hooks outside the configured scopes.

## Compatibility and Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Android | Android 13 (API 33) or later |
| System | Compatible Xiaomi HyperOS 4 Beta build |
| Root framework | Root access and LSPosed API 101 or later |
| Architecture | The release APK is universal; device compatibility is determined by the target HyperOS build |

HyperChanger relies on implementation details of Xiaomi system packages. Update the module only after keeping a way to disable it through LSPosed or recovery if you are testing a new system build.

## Module Scopes

Enable HyperChanger in LSPosed and select only the scopes required for the features you use. The module declares the following supported packages:

| Scope | Package |
| --- | --- |
| System UI | `com.android.systemui` |
| System UI plugin | `miui.systemui.plugin` |
| Always-on display | `com.miui.aod` |
| Xiaomi Camera | `com.android.camera` |
| Xiaomi Gallery | `com.miui.gallery` |
| Hyper Gallery plugin | `com.hyper.gallery.plugin` |
| Media editor | `com.miui.mediaeditor` |

Some packages are optional and may not be installed on every device. LSPosed will only activate hooks for installed, selected scopes.

## Installation

1. Download the latest signed APK from [Releases](https://github.com/ColdP/HyperChanger/releases).
2. Install the APK normally. If Android blocks the install, allow the installer source when prompted.
3. In LSPosed, enable HyperChanger and select the scopes required for your configuration.
4. Open HyperChanger and set the desired options.
5. Use the in-app restart action, or restart the affected System UI process, after changing System UI settings.

Do not enable every scope solely for convenience. Enabling only the packages used by your configuration reduces the number of processes that load the module.

## Using Presets

The notification-shade preset page supports built-in and user-defined presets. Long-press a preset to access export options, then choose JSON or QR code sharing. Importing validates the HyperChanger preset format and version before settings are applied.

Imported settings can affect several visual options at once. Review the result and restart System UI to apply hook-based changes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Recommended action |
| --- | --- |
| A change does not take effect | Confirm the required LSPosed scope is enabled, then restart the affected process. |
| System UI repeatedly restarts | Disable HyperChanger in LSPosed, reboot, and re-enable settings one at a time. |
| A page has no effect on a device | The corresponding HyperOS build may not expose a compatible implementation. Leave the option disabled and include device and system details in an issue. |
| Import fails | Confirm the file or QR code was exported by a compatible HyperChanger release. |

When reporting an issue, include the device model, Android and HyperOS versions, HyperChanger version, enabled scopes, reproduction steps, and relevant Logcat output with personal data removed.

## Build From Source

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Narwhal (2025.1) or later
- JDK 17 or later
- Android SDK 37
- A device running Android 13 (API 33) or later for installation testing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColdP/HyperChanger.git
cd HyperChanger
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### Release Build and Signing

Build the optimized release variant with a keystore stored outside the repository:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease \
  -PreleaseStoreFile=/absolute/path/to/keystore \
  -PreleaseStorePassword=your-store-password \
  -PreleaseKeyAlias=your-key-alias \
  -PreleaseKeyPassword=your-key-password
```

The signed APK is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Never commit a keystore, its password, or a generated APK to the repository.
